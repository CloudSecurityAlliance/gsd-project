# Global Security Database Project Plans

The Global Security Database is a new Working Group project from the Cloud Security Alliance meant to address the gaps in the current vulnerability identifier space.

The world of vulnerability identifiers has changed drastically in the last 20 years while the infrastructure and management of public and private vulnerability data have changed very little. This has created a sizable gap between the current needs of industry and the ability of existing projects to be effective.

This is the Global Security Database (GSD) Project Plans which contains all the GSD project plans and related material. For more informaiton please see https://csaurl.org/gsd-quick-links.

## Identity and attribution for participation

Currently the GSD requires identity/atttribution for participation in GitHub to a GitHub account, this is a technical limitation/feature of the platform. Participation in the public email lists/Twitter/etc. for example does NOT require a GitHub account (or any identity beyond a working email address/Twitter account/etc.). Truly anonymous participation is not explicitly supported, however pseudonymity is supported and welcome.
